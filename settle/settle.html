          This project started as an exploration into alternatives to furniture disposal. To get a better grasp of the problem space, we visited local initiatives that, and interviewed four people who had recently gone through the downsizing process. Our conversations revealed that small, sentimental items proved most difficult to part with, rather than the large pieces of furniture as we had imagined.
