            I attempted SiGuNiang II on June 27, 2017, the day after summiting SiGuNiang I, a peak 200m shorter, a few kilometers from the former. Leaving the base camp at around 2 in the morning, my guide Yu and I reached the East Col at around 8 in the morning, becoming the first to reach the East Col of SiGuNiang II in two months. However, further up, we encountered waist deep snow, combined with the danger of possible avalanche, we had to abort at an altitude of around 5100m.

            My wife Hannah and I sucessfully reached the summit of Mount Ngauruhoe, as part of trekking the Tongariro Crossing. I was hit by a falling rock on my left ankle while climbing the mountain. We walked a total of around 25 km that day and I sweared I would not do anything like this again in my entire life. A few weeks after I was on my way to climbing Mount SiGuNiang. I guess once you start climbing, there's just no way back.

            I solo ascended Mount Kurow (also called Mount Kohurau), the highest peak in the St. Marys Range, on the date of May 2, 2017. Overestimated myself and underestimated the mountain, I parted with my wife Hannah and another teammate at an altitude of around 1500m, I proceeded to the climbing solo, without bringing food or water. I summited at around 2pm when the weather started to change. Thirsty and without drinking water, I ate snow to keep hydrated, which dropped my body temperature even further. Coming down from the steep summit was a long, relatively flat and exposed ridge. Having used most of my energy reserve climbing up and down from the summit, I started to doubt if I could make it to the foot of the mountain. Coming off the ridge, because of dehydration and low blood sugar, I began to have hallucination, and my mind was becoming vague. There were many times that I thought I could not make another step, but my animal instinct of surviving just kept telling me that I had to keep moving. If I sit down for once, I would not be able to stand up and make it out of this mountain alive. Looking back, what went on in my mind was bizarre. I started to think about tricks to catch a rabbit or a deer and drink its blood, and all the grass around me started to look very appetizing. I still remember clearly of when I made it to the foot of the hill, almost crawling on the ground, and I saw a red dot from very far away. When I got close, I discerned it was a tomato, and a piece of paper under it, which says: don't worry, I've got people to help you, and we are on our way -- Hannah. That was no doubt the most scrumptious tomato I have ever had in my entire life.
