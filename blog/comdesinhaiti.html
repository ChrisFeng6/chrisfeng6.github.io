One of the first things you will notice when traveling in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti is probably that there’re surprising few restaurants or stores. However, that’s actually not the case; there simply aren’t many restaurants or stores with apparent signs. This is because that people follow a completely different set of rules for communication design than what we would expect based on our experience living in developed countries. 
</br></br>
Signs and billboards are a way to communicate information, perhaps the way we are most familiar with; however, there are ways that are more primitive, complex, maybe less efficient, but have larger impact on people’s life. That way of communication is the word of mouth. People in Haiti do not rely on signs to recognize restaurants, instead, quoted a local person, “they just know”. People just know there is a restaurant, who owns it, and what it sells; signs are simply not needed. This phenomenon can actually been seen in many other forms of business. Every traveler to Port-Au-Prince must notice the colorful minivans, or “mini-truck” to be precise, full of people, everywhere on the street. They are called “pat-pat” by westerners. They consist of a vast complex system of public transport in Port-Au-Prince. Serving the function of public bus as in western cities, these pat-pats have prescribed routes around the city. However, no sign, no route, no destination, or any kind of indication of where the “bus” is going, how much its cost, is written on the bus. These “buses” have no dedicated station; people simply pat on the truck to signal it to stop and get on the bus, pat again to signal to the driver that the passenger has reached his or her destination. When we asked how do people know which bus is which and where each one goes, its the same answer: “they just know”. 
</br></br>
Information is exchanged through a person talking to another person, which in a large scale, forms a vast network of people. When a person goes to a restaurant and likes the food, he or she will tell ten people, and these ten will tell a hundred. Soon the entire community knows about the restaurant. The survival or prosperous of a business is solely dominated by a form of evolution. If the food served in a restaurant is good, everyone knows it. If the food served in a restaurant is bad, everyone knows it as well. Very soon, the good ones live and the bad ones die. Information is exchanged through a complex system of people; as a result, personal connection and close personal relationship is the key to survival. The reason is very simple: you cannot even find a place to eat without knowing people. 
</br></br>
This vast network of tight personal relationships is reinforced in basically every social activity happening on a daily basis. Think about the journey map of our persona, Jack, a middle class worker living in Newark, New Jersey, buying an apple from the local supermarket. 1. Jack drives his car to the supermarket. 2. Jack navigates to the fruit section following signs in the supermarket. 3. Jack finds an apple and pays through a self-checkout kiosk. This series of actions can happen without a single interaction with another person. Now let’s think about Emmanuel, a Haitian living in Port-Au-Prince, and his journey of buying an apple. 1. Emmanuel starts from his home, without any technology like Google Map, asks his friend where he could buy an apple. 2. His friend shows him the way. 3. Arrives at the market, not knowing where to find the merchant who sells apples, Emmanuel asks a person he met at the entrance of the market. 4. Emmanuel finds an apple, negotiates price with the merchant, and make the payment. In these two environments, to achieve the exact same goal, a person has to go through complete different series of interaction. The former might be more efficient in terms of time; however, more importantly, the later contains much richer social interactions, which through a long time, creates and reinforce personal relationships. In other words, Emmanuel is simply more likely to have a lot more friends than Jack. 
</br></br>
From my brief stay in Port-Au-Prince, my observation confirmed my speculation. Communities are extremely tight-knit; people constantly greet each other when passing by on the street; public areas like the dirt road in front houses are used as a gathering ground for everyone in the afternoon, where information is exchanged; Neighbors know each others very well and very ofter help each others out on a daily basis; merchants share the resources of customers in the same market. The list goes on forever. 
</br></br>
This form of exchange of information through social and personal interaction is the most primitive, and it has a profound impact on many other aspects of society. Although extremely poor, people in Haiti are exceptionally happy. On the bus, which is more of a minivan, from Port-Au-Prince to Jacmel, people were constantly talking, playing music, and occasionally bursting into laughs. On the streets, students waved at us friendly, giggling. Although lacking money and materialistic comfort, street food merchant knows every single one of her customers and greets them with a piece of freshly made barbecue chicken. On the exact opposite, middle class workers in New York, earning ten time more money than their counterparts in Port-Au-Prince, stare at their phone, standing in cramped subway, busy replying to their emails, with tired and surly faces. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau said, people are born to be social beings; they get joy through establishing emotional connection with other people. As Haruki Murakami expressed in his book Pinball, 1973, in modern societies, people are living a more “solo” life; as we start to build even more emotional connection with objects than with people, our human nature is distorted, and decrease in utility (happiness) is inevitable. 
</br></br>
While traditional communication design is ever striving to deliver information more efficiently through media and screens, we shall not ignore the impact of on people’s life of taking away their personal interaction, social connection and emotional interdependence, by automizing everything in the virtual space.
