In the article “Religious Belief without Evidence”, to defend the rationality of belief in God, Alvin Plantinga uses the example of seeing a tree to demonstrate the definition of “properly basic” belief. He maintains that although many beliefs, like the belief of the existence of a tree just by seeing a tree, we seem to be justified holding do not necessarily fit into the fundationalist’s framework of rationality. However, Plantinga argues that if a belief fulfills certain criteria, it can be categorized as a “properly basic” belief, which is rational by itself. Beliefs that rest on such basic beliefs are also properly basic, although they might not fulfill fundationalist’s criteria of one belief being rational. He defends the rationality of properly basic beliefs by using the example of seeing a tree. He states that our belief of the existence of a tree merely from seeing a tree comes from our memory and experience of seeing a tree in the past. However, according to fundationalists, experience and memory are conceptual, and thus can be arbitrary, or in other words not self-evident. Thus experience or memory is not sufficient to justify the rationality of the belief in the existence of a tree. I find this example intriguingly interesting to think about and talk about. Starting form this example of seeing a tree, I want to try to defend the rationality of beliefs in the existence of common objects just by the seeing those objects, by defending the credibility of human observation and perception. 
</br></br>
In a daily circumstance, we reach the conclusion that there actually exists a tree the moment we see a tree without even any thinking. According to Plantinga, the belief of the existence of the tree rests on two premises: firstly, as soon as we see a “tree-like” object, we confirm the existence of such “tree-like” object; secondly, we reach the conclusion that the tree-like object is actually a tree form our past memory and experience of a tree. Then, we hold the belief that there exists a tree. I want to divide my essay into two parts, each defending the rationality of each premise. 
</br></br>
      <span class = "subtitle">What we see to be real is real</span>
The first premise in Plantinga’s tree example is “the fact that we see a tree-like object is sufficient enough to prove the existence of such tree-like object”. Rene Descartes once questions such deduction in his “Meditation on First Philosophy” by claiming that we can never know whether we are dreaming or awake at any time. Thus whenever we think that see an object, we can never confirm whether we are dreaming about seeing such object or we actually see it in reality. Thus, we cannot reach the conclusion that there actually exists a tree-like object merely from the fact that we think we have seen it. 
</br></br>
Descartes’s argument is indeed convincing and hard to thoroughly dispute. I want to use several facts that are generally true, but not necessarily always true to compromise Descartes’s argument while I cannot convincingly overthrow it. I want to use the following reasons to support that we can usually if not always distinguish reality form dream so that we can confirm that we are awake and when we see a tree-like object existing there does exist one.  
</br></br>
Firstly, reality is always perfectly coherent while a dream is usually coherent. In reality, if we do not have any amnesiac illness, we can easily recover our memory of what we did one minutes ago, ten minutes ago, one week ago or significant events years ago; and these events happen in a perfect series of logic. We can easily remember the reason why we did something or the relation between a series of things. On the other hand, it is usually not the case in a dream. A long series of dreams that are coherent to each other hardly happen. In a dream, we can hardly remember what happen before or the timeline of events taking place. We usually can neither remember the reason why we are there in certain places nor the reason why doing certain things in a dream. Thus, next time when we see a tree-like object, take a moment to think about what has happened a few minutes ago, the reason why I am here and how I get here. If I can answer each question, the there is a great, if not absolute possibility that I am not reaming; what I see does exist in reality.
</br></br>
Secondly, reality is always composed of vivid and clear color, of objects with obvious edges that distinguish them from each other and of infinite complexity. All the colors that appear in reality are those we can recognize and those we can tell their name. However, color can be less vivid, undistinguishable or hard to comprehend in dreams. All objects in reality have their unique nature and properties while things can appear to be fuzzy in a dream and objects can possess properties that should not belong to them. Additionally, in reality, the texture of every material is infinitely complex. In other words, every object in reality is perfectly detailed. However, dreams are hardly as detailed as reality it. Thus, next time we see a tree-like object, if everything around us has vivid color, clear edges and complex detail, what we see should be a real tree-like object. 
</br></br>
Thirdly, dreams usually do not rigidly follow all the physical laws. Some people may argue that although things that do not obey physical laws usually take place in a dream, we can hardly notice them when we are in the dream; we can only realize that something wired happened in our dream after we weak up. While this is generally true, I think the reason why we cannot notice abnormal things happening while in our dream is that we do not question the logic or reasonability when we are in a dream. However, if we start to ask ourselves if we are dreaming when we are actually in a dream, we would notice things that disobey physical laws happening or more usually we would weak up from the dream. If one is to develop a habit that whenever he sees a tree-like object, he asks himself whether he is dreaming or not, he would have a great chance to confirm the credibility of the existence of such object.
</br></br>
Moreover, in Descartes’s argument, he claims that it is impossible to decide whether we are in reality or in our dreams, which implies that there is no such sign that can be used to distinguish reality from a dream. In other words, there is nothing that only appears in dreams but not in reality or anything that only appears in reality but not in dreams by which we can use to distinguish reality and dreams. Thus, according to Descartes, dreams and reality are identical. If there is not a single difference between a dream and reality, they are just two independent states of being which we can arbitrarily give them two different names. In this sense, whether we are in a “dream” or in “reality” does not matter at all because they are just the same; what matters is only how we name each state of being. In this case, whenever I see a tree-like object, I can immediately call the state in am in as “reality” and that state would be unquestionably “reality”. Then what we see should always be “real”.
</br></br>
Finally, according to Descartes’s argument, it is essentially impossible to determine whether we are in reality or in a dream; then it is a state quite similar to the one described in Pascal’s Wager, where people have to choose from to believe or not to believe in God and God may or may not exist. Similarly, one has only two choices: convince himself that he is in a dream or convince himself that he is in reality; and there are two possibilities, he is actually in reality or he is actually in a dream. If he is to believe that he is in a dream, he can do whatever he wants, proper things and improper things in a normal sense. In this case, if he is indeed in a dream, he would not get any benefit because everything is unreal; if he is in reality, his improper behavior would incur punishment, which is undesirable. On the other hand, if he is to convince himself that he is living in reality, he would not do anything that can bring him into trouble. In this case, if he actually is in reality, what he does can actually bring him substantial benefits while if he is in dream, nothing would bring him any harm. Thus, in conclusion, a person can earn nothing but potentially get punishment if he is to believe that he is in a dream; while he can potentially get benefits but never lose anything if he is to always believe that he is in reality. Thus, it would only be beneficial if one is to always believe that he is living in reality. Moreover, because there is by no means to disprove his believe as nobody can prove whether he is in a dream or in reality. Thus, it is never wrong to believe in the existence of the tree-like object whenever he sees one.
</br></br>
These reasons all support that by certain methods, people can confirm, with a decent extent of accuracy, that they are in reality, instead of in a dream; or that there is nothing wrong to believe that they are in reality. Thus, whenever we see a tree-like object, we can pretty sure confirm the existence of such object.
</br></br>
        <span class = "subtitle">The Rationality of Memory and Experience</span>
After we are convinced the existence of a tree-like object whenever we see one, on a daily basis, according to Plantinga, how we interpret such object as a tree is based on our concept of how a tree should look like. Such concept is formed from the accumulation of memory and experience of seeing a tree in the past. According to the fundationalist’s criteria of rationality, experience and memory are conceptual, and thus can be arbitrary, or in other words not self-evident. Thus experience or memory is not sufficient to justify the rationality of the belief that a tree-like object is an actual tree. However, I believe that experience and memory are substantial and evidential enough to support the rationality of a belief of the existence of a tree and I am going to use three examples concerning the development of children and two other examples to support my claim.
</br></br>
It is easy to see that there are substantial differences between an adult and a new-born baby besides physical differences. It is undeniable that a baby grows not only physically when he matures to be an adult. What causes these changes is actually nothing but experience and memory. All the education he gets is an accumulation of experience and memory. 
</br></br>
Firstly, there is a substantial difference between a baby who has not yet acquired skill of any kind and a man who possesses the skill of building a table. It is obvious enough that the latter can make a substantial difference by building a table while the former cannot. What makes the difference is nothing but memory of technics and of seeing other people building ones; and experience of practice in building a table.
</br></br>
Secondly, there is an undeniable difference between a new-born baby who cannot speak a word and a man who can utilize language to express his ideas. It is the memory of vocabularies, grammar and experience of using the language all the time that makes the difference of being able to speak a language and not being able to.
</br></br>
Thirdly, what makes people to make conditioned reflex is also memory and experience. After a child touches a hot stove and gets burned for the first time, he would know not to touch a stove when he sees one next time. What makes this difference is nothing but the experience of touching a stove and the memory of the fact that a hot stove can burn one’s fingers.
</br></br>
Moreover, it is undeniable that over the development of human technology and civilization, there is an ever growing of human knowledge if we are to consider the body of human knowledge as a whole. The accumulation of human knowledge certain has brought substantial changes to our society as whole. Just to take one simple case as an example: people could not make a computer two hundred years ago while computers are so generally used now. The growth of the body of human knowledge is the integration of new memory of knowledge and new experience of trial and error in the process of making a computer.
</br></br>
Finally, if one is to deny the credibility of memory and experience, it is no different from denying the credibility of “evidence” as a whole”. Evidence, according to my understanding, is the integration of what people see and say, which all converted into memory of the people who see and say; and the integration of previous experience of dealing with similar cases. In a word, evidence is the accumulation of memory and experience of different sources and kinds. All the physical laws are reached by collecting and integrating of evidences while the study of philosophy is all based on evidence. If one is to deny the credibility of memory and experience, he is to deny the credibility of evidence; consequently to deny the ground of science and philosophy. In this sense, memory and experience are more reasonable to be deemed some credibility.
</br></br>
The belief of the existence of a tree or any common object from the fact of seeing them can seem self-evident enough to be deemed rational. By my trial to dispute Descartes’s doubt on the reliability of “reality” and the fundationalist’s denial of credibility of memory and experience, I try to defend what we belief to be as obvious as common sense with more solid argumentation. To make my argument against Descartes more convincing, study on the nature of mind from a neuron science approach would be helpful.
