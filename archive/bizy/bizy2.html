          In the summer of 2016, I worked as an User Experience Design Intern at <a href="http://www.bizy.com/" class = "link" target="_blank">Bizy, LLC</a>, a technology company based in Washington DC, whose aim is to create an online platform to revolutionize leadership system and decision-making process for modern teams, using Intelligent Conversation & Leadership Activities.

          The dashboard is the single most important interface in the Bizy mobile app. The dashboard is where the users can see all his/her projects and where all new notifications get displayed. I was given the task to design the dashboard from scratch so that users can accomplish the most with the least clicks possible.

          The design of the dashboard is very challenging. A lot of imformation of different types need to be shown while not making the screen too crowded or overwhelming. One major challenge is to handle the situation when a lot of new activities are going on in many different projects. The user should be able to go through and participate in different activities without having to click into and out of different projects all the time. Each component of the interface is carefully designed and tested.

          <img src = "img/7.png" class="span_1">
          <p class = "paragraph half_right"  >
          Each project is displayed as a block. The dashboard contains all the projects the user has.

            User can bookmark each project with different color. When there are a large amount of projects, it helps the user to identify any specific one quickly. The bookmark also allows the user to mark projects with different priority/type with their personal preference.

          A bright, prominent red dot show how many strong notifications the user has from each project.

            A preview of the messages/activities allows the user to see new messages from different projects without leaving the dashboard.

          When there are multiple messages from one project, the user can user the back/forward arrows to quickly navigate through them.

            The action bar allows the user to respond to any message or activity without clicking into the project. If needed, the “Go to” button will take the user directly to the corresponding message.
