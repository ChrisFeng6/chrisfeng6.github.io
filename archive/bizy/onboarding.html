          I first came up with a few possible approaches to design the onboarding process and the pros and cons of each of them.
          </p>
          <!-- txt version of the ideas
          <ul>
            <li><p class = "continuous">Guide a new user thorugh a series of activities with arrows/prompt/overlay. Give prompts of what to do and buttons to click.</br>
            <span class = "p_c">Advantage: a good way to learn the app quickly, everything is orchestrated, just follow. </br></span>
            <span class = "p_c">Disadvantage: Not so self-paced, the user may feel like they’re forced into it.</span></p></li>

            <li><p class = "continuous">Create a fake team in the stream showing all the functions (Something like the current invision prototype?).</br>
            <span class = "p_c">Advantage:  Self-paced, the user wouldn’t feel forced into it. </br></span>
            <span class = "p_c">Disadvantage:  the user can’t see how things are done, nor the process of an activity. (voting)</span></p></li>

            <li><p class = "continuous">Create a few default activities and the user learn by doing these activities.</br>
            <span class = "p_c">Advantage: a very nice integration into the app’s native function.</br></span>
            <span class = "p_c">Disadvantage: The user has to switch back and forth between the demo activities list and what they’re told to do.</span></p></li>

            <li><p class = "continuous">Make the users to watch demo videos.</br>
            <span class = "p_c">Advantage:  Easier to digest than textual information.</br></span>
            <span class = "p_c">Disadvantage: Not hands-on, the user may get bored after a while.</span></p></li>

            <li><p class = "continuous">Show a few static screenshots and guide when the user first login, swipe left to go to the next one, finish all to enter app. (Like a slide show)</br>
            <span class = "p_c">Advantage:  Easy and clear flow of interaction. Fast.</br></span>
            <span class = "p_c">Disadvantage: Users will very likely skip all of them and enter the app confused.</span></p></li>

            <li><p class = "continuous">With no strictly guided tour, once the user enter a new interface for the first time, prompt a short guide/description.</br>
            <span class = "p_c">Advantage:  More flexibility then the guided tour, provide guide when the user need it the most, therfore more likely to remember.</br></span>
            <span class = "p_c">Disadvantage: may interupt the the user’s workflow as there are so many functions in Bizy and the user may not have seen some even after using for a while.</span></p></li>

            <li><p class = "continuous">Animation of using the app playing as background somewhere through the signup process, or playing in a seperate page some point in the process.</br>
            <span class = "p_c">Advantage: Clear and straightforward, takes shorter time than the guided or unguided tour</br></span>
            <span class = "p_c">Disadvantage: May be very distracting if putting it as background of a signup screen. If put into a seperate page, then their is essentially no difference from playing a video.</span></p></li>

          After exploring a number of different ideas and iterating on a few of them, our team narrowed down onto the following design: a series of carefully orchestrated interactions to demonstrate the key features of our app: facilitating conversations with prompts and facilitating decision making through activities like brainstorm, voting and ranking. The interaction is broken into a dozen stages where each one or two introduces one feature.</br>

            Talk about the prototyping requirement and how I landed on using P5 and how I learned to use P5 in just a few days.</br></br>The point of this project is to demonstrate the important featues of the app like brainstorming, voting and ranking. So I stripped the UI emelents and only left the key component and the interaction.</h3>
