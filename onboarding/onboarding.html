          <p class = "paragraph">
          Bizy is a powerful collaboration platform. It can be confusing to users at first and the large amount of activities it can perform can be intimidating to new users. My task was to research and design an onboarding experience which introduces the important features of Bizy in a friendly way and guides new users through some important interactions, on mobile platform. The project later evolved into making an interactive experience demonstrating how a team can streamline the decision process with Bizy, while still serving as an onboarding tool.

          The most challenging part of this project is having to do a task that I have barely any prior experience in. I had to pick the right tool and learn it in a very short amount of time. What's more challenging, but exciting at the same time is that I had to not only make the prototype but also to deliver it with a professional standard of quality for every detail of the product.
          </p>
          <p class = "paragraph">
          Picking the right tool was the first step to success. I chose P5.js to make this interactive animation prototype, because of a few reasons: 1. It is versatile. With tools like Principle or Framer, my idea and creativity may be constrained by the setup of the software. 2. A javascript library like P5 allows me to make truly interactive experience and test them on multiple platforms. With tools like Adobe After Effects, though very sophisticated animation could be visualized, without the interactive feature, the prototype could fully represent the concept and to be properly tested.
          </p>
          <p class = "paragraph">
          The most rewarding part of this project is to learn a completely new tool and use it to solve real problems. I learned P5.js, a javascript library in tow days and spent the following three weeks designing and coding a fully functional interactive prototype. There is nothing more rewarding than proving myself that I'm not only able but so enthusiastic about learning new technology/skills to solve new problems.
